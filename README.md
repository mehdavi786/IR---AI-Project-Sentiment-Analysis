# IR---AI-Project-Sentiment-Analysis
Implemented 8 different algorithms used in a research paper to classify movie comments.

The main idea of this project was to bring the results as close as shown in the paper or better than them. The different algorithms used in the paper were:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Support Vector Machines
3. RBF Support Vector Machines
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. K Nearest Neighbour
7. Multinomial Naive Bayes
8. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

 We first done some data exploration using pandas, matplotlib and wordcloud. The data is then splitted into train and test datasets. Then tf-idf vectorizer is called, and finally all the models are trained and were used to predict the test data.

The metrics used are accuracy score and the confusion matrix.
